### Project: Multi-Signature smart contract wallet for ethereum accounts. The wallet lets you send and receive ether, set a certain number of number given n >= quorum to make a transaction and shows you the most basic information. 

### For security purposes, every time you create a "safe", the creator(s) will deploy the smart contract, so each individual deployer will interact with its own safe. The code for all the safes are the same, you can find the "proxy" contract with the name "MultiSigWallet.sol"
