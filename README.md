### Project Description: 

##### Multi-Signature smart contract wallet for ethereum accounts. The wallet lets you send and receive ether, set a minimum quorum (signatures of owners) to execute transactions and shows you the most basic information. 

### 2. For security purposes, every time you create a "safe", the creator(s) will deploy the smart contract, so each individual deployer will interact with its own safe. The code for all the safes are the same, you can find the "proxy" contract with the name "MultiSigWallet.sol"

### 3. --> Project's frontend can be found inside of the "wallet-frontend" folder.

### 4. --> The smart contracts and test cases can be found inside of the "wallet" folder.
