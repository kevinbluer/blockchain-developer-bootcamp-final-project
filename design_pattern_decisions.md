## Inheritance 

#### The contract inherits from a receiver in order to keep track of the deployed safes.


## Proxy Like 

#### Each contract is a new deployment of the base implementation, behaving like a clone proxy. This ensures safety for the deployer or owner of the safe. 



## Ownable
#### All the functions that change the state, can only be called from the owner. This ensures safety.
